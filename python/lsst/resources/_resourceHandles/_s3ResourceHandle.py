class S3ResourceHandle(BaseResourceHandle[bytes]):
    """S3 specialization of `BaseResourceHandle`

    Parameters
    ----------
    mode : `str`
        Handle modes as described in the python `io` module.
    log : `~logging.Logger`
        Logger to used when writing messages.
    client : `boto3.client`
        An existing boto3 client that will be used for interacting with the
        remote s3 server.
    bucket : `str`
        The name of the s3 bucket of this resource.
    key : `str`
        The identifier of the resource within the specified bucket.
    newline : `str`
        When doing multiline operations, break the stream on given character.
        Defaults to newline.

    Note
    ----
    It is only possible to incrementally flush this object if each chunk that
    is flushed is above 5MB in size. The flush command is ignored until the
    internal buffer reaches this size, or until close is called, whichever
    comes first.

    Once an instance in write mode is flushed, it is not possible to seek back
    to a position in the byte stream before the flush is executed.

    When opening a resource in read write mode (r+ or w+) no flushing is
    possible, and all data will be buffered until the resource is closed and
    the buffered data will be written. Additionally the entire contents of the
    resource will be loaded into memory upon opening.

    Documentation on the methods of this class line should refer to the
    corresponding methods in the `io` module.

    S3 handles only support operations in binary mode. To get other modes of
    reading and writing, wrap this handle inside an `io.TextIOWrapper` context
    manager. An example of this can be found in `S3ResourcePath`.
